Multiplayer obstacle course where you race downhill, finding the optimal route and trying to beat your best score. Can you beat your friends?

This project was completed in 48 hours.

Made using various art assets as well as implementing **[Normcore](https://normcore.io/)** for P2P networking solution. We were able to develop the game and do testing as well as the publication and showcase for the jam without using up the time allocated in the *free* tier, so we were happy with that!
